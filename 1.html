<h2>Bajaj Pulsar RS 200 Expert Opinion</h2>
<p>I was excited when I got an email from Bajaj Motorcycles to test their new motorcycle,<br>
     the Pulsar RS200, at their Chakan test track. And there were two reasons<br>
      - the Pulsar RS200 and the Chakan track. Over the last couple of months, we have written<br>
       quite a few articles on the Pulsar RS200 ranging from it being spied around Pune to its <br>
       name changing from SS200 to RS200. Honestly, I don’t think we have written so many spy <br>
       pictures story for any another bike like we have done for the Pulsar RS200. It was the <br>
       most anticipated motorcycle from Bajaj because it was going to open the doors of the <br>
       budget fully-faired entry-level performance motorcycles. With India’s ever growing <br>
       young population, the Pulsar RS200 seems to have attracted lot of interest. We take the<br> 
       Pulsar RS200 for a spin at Bajaj’s test track to find out how far it will take the legacy<br>
        of the Pulsar brand.</p>
